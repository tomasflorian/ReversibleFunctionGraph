// Nothing here is built around RFG. There is a record, a rate card, a bit of
// arithmetic and an interface — the code you would write anyway — and the only
// trace of the graph is the word `Atoms` appearing beside work that already
// happened. Delete every one of those lines and this is still a working program;
// it just stops saying what it did.
//
// The three ways of saying it are used in turn, and they are the same mechanism
// wearing less and less clothing:
//
//   1. Atoms.Log     say it afterwards, like logger.Info
//   2. Atoms.Call    wrap the call you wanted recorded
//   3. Atoms.Watch   record everything through an interface, call sites untouched
//
// It works on records the TypeScript producer already sent, so these atoms hang
// off nodes another program in another language made — with no arrangement
// between them beyond both writing down the same strings.

    // because the same call written down twice is the same atom.

    // than reported on afterwards. The value comes back as usual and the rest of
    // the code does not notice.
