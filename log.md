# log

Things that were tried and then set down again.

Being in this pile carries no verdict. It means the thing was looked at,
something was learned, and it was put aside for now — that is all it means. An
entry may be picked back up unchanged, picked up in a different form, or left
alone. Nothing here is settled.

Each entry says what was tried and what came out of it, and closes with what I
said about it at the time.

## Keeping a call that returned nothing

**Tried.** `Node.apply` returns the `∅` node as soon as a function hands back
`null`, before any application node is built, so a call that came back empty
leaves nothing behind. The idea was to build the application anyway and point it
at `∅`, so the graph would hold "this was asked, and nothing came back" the same
way it holds every other call. `types` applies 7 predicates to 7 values; the
graph keeps 16 of those 49 calls, and `∅` sits in it as a node with no edges.

**What came out.** Set down before it was built. The empty answers are the
ordinary case — most strings are not an IP — and re-running the predicate
answers the same question. A blank cell reading as "nothing came back" is the
intended reading. A blank cell currently covers both that and a call nobody
made, with nothing in the picture separating them.

## Splitting selecting calls out of the pivot

**Tried.** `gaze.ts` builds a column name by folding a call's extra arguments in:
`word(·,old)`. `record` defines its fields as one-argument functions, so its
columns are plain names and rows stack. `sequence` defines `elem` as a
two-argument function that hands back the part it was given, so each element
mints a column of its own. In `text`, one row looks like this:

```
subject         | word(·,city) | word(·,is) | word(·,old) | word(·,the)
the|city|is|old | city         | is         | old         | the
```

The change: in `pivot()`, notice a call whose result is one of its own arguments
(`extra.includes(res)`), keep it out of the pivot, and collect those into
`listings(g)` — subject plus the items, keyed on `(subject, fn)`. `view.ts`
shipped them; `graph.html` drew them under both pivot tabs.

**What came out.** Built and run across all twelve scenarios. Nodes and edges
came out identical everywhere; only the `pivot` and `tables` sections of the
snapshots moved.

| scenario | tables | listings | pivot columns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `text` | 12 → 4 | 8 | 20 → 4 |
| `general-demo` | 32 → 16 | 22 | 63 → 18 |
| `path` | 5 → 4 | 1 | 10 → 8 |
| the other nine | unchanged | 0 | unchanged |

`text-index`, the anti-scenario, came out unchanged — indexing gives
`word(list,"0") → "paris"`, and `"paris"` is not `"0"`, so nothing in it looked
like a selecting call. 6 of `general-demo`'s 22 listings were `hasFormat` tags
rather than lists; `hasFormat` is written as `(_raw, name) => name`, so it hands
back its own argument too and was collected alongside them.

Reverted afterwards; the code is not kept anywhere.

## Marking listings by their separator

**Tried.** Rather than working it out in the gaze, put the fact in the graph:
define something like `isListing`, apply it to any value carrying a `|`, and
find the lists by clicking the function node — the same move every other fact in
the graph makes, with nothing new to build.

**What came out.** Checked against the snapshots before building. `sequence`
uses `|` between elements, and `record` accepts `|` as a field separator, which
`timesheet` and `timesheet-cli` both use, so the timesheet rows carry a `|` too:

```
nodes with "|" that a separator check would pick up
  text            8      general-demo   16
  timesheet       4      timesheet-cli   6
```

`bob|2026-08-25|projX|8` is a record written with the same character. Marking
the list node also leaves the pivot columns as they were — `word(·,old)` is
minted by the element calls, not by the list, so `text` stays at 12 tables
either way.

A version where `sequence` says so itself when it cuts a list, rather than
anything reading the separator afterwards, was sketched and not built.
